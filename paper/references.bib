  abstract = {A magic square is a square matrix whereby the sum of any row, column, or any one of the two principal diagonals is equal. A surrogate of this abstract mathematical construct, introduced in 2012 by Fahimi and Jaleh, is the “electrostatic potential (ESP)” that results from treating the matrix elements of the magic square as electric charges. The overarching idea is to characterize patterns associated with these matrices that can possibly be used, in the future, in reverse to generate these squares. This study focuses on squares of order 4 and 5 with 880 and 275,305,224 distinct (irreducible/unique) realizations, respectively. It is shown that characteristic patterns emerge from plots of the ESPs of the matrices representing the studied squares. The electrostatic potentials for natural magic squares exhibit a striking pattern of maxima and minima in all distinct 880 of the 4th order and all distinct 275,305,224 of the 5th order matrices. The minimum values of ESP of Dudeney groups are discussed. Equipotential points and certain constants are found among the ESP sums along horizontal and vertical lines on the square lattice. These findings may help to open a new perspective regarding magic squares unsolved problems. While mathematics often leads discovery in physics, the latter (physics) is used here to detect otherwise invisible patterns in a mathematical object such as magic squares.}

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               Based upon Craig G. Fraser, Lagrange both popularized and extended his view that the differential and integral calculus could be based solely on assuming the Taylor expansion of a function in an infinite power series and on algebraic manipulations thereafter. He also made some applications to problems in geometry and mechanics. An important and under-appreciated contribution of the history of mathematics is to provide insight into the foundations of a mathematical theory by identifying the characteristics of historically earlier formulations of the theory. The conceptual relativism of scientific theories over history is one of the major findings of the history of science since Thomas Kuhn. In this respect, history of mathematics possesses a special interest lacking in the history of other branches of science, because earlier mathematical theories are enduring objects of technical interest and even of further development. Finally, even after the consolidation of Cauchy's arithmetical foundation, Lagrange's emphasis on the algorithmic, operational character of the calculus continued to inform writers of textbooks as well as non-mathematicians such as engineers and physicists who used calculus in their research and teaching.}

  abstract = {Our objective is to understand the notion of type in programming languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming languages.Object-oriented languages provide both a framework and a motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type, data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important form of polymorphism. We develop a λ-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.The evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed λ-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.The typed λ-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented λ-calculus are discussed.The augmented typed λ-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of λ is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.Fun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented languages.},
