  abstract = {A magic square is a square matrix whereby the sum of any row, column, or any one of the two principal diagonals is equal. A surrogate of this abstract mathematical construct, introduced in 2012 by Fahimi and Jaleh, is the “electrostatic potential (ESP)” that results from treating the matrix elements of the magic square as electric charges. The overarching idea is to characterize patterns associated with these matrices that can possibly be used, in the future, in reverse to generate these squares. This study focuses on squares of order 4 and 5 with 880 and 275,305,224 distinct (irreducible/unique) realizations, respectively. It is shown that characteristic patterns emerge from plots of the ESPs of the matrices representing the studied squares. The electrostatic potentials for natural magic squares exhibit a striking pattern of maxima and minima in all distinct 880 of the 4th order and all distinct 275,305,224 of the 5th order matrices. The minimum values of ESP of Dudeney groups are discussed. Equipotential points and certain constants are found among the ESP sums along horizontal and vertical lines on the square lattice. These findings may help to open a new perspective regarding magic squares unsolved problems. While mathematics often leads discovery in physics, the latter (physics) is used here to detect otherwise invisible patterns in a mathematical object such as magic squares.}

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               Based upon Craig G. Fraser, Lagrange both popularized and extended his view that the differential and integral calculus could be based solely on assuming the Taylor expansion of a function in an infinite power series and on algebraic manipulations thereafter. He also made some applications to problems in geometry and mechanics. An important and under-appreciated contribution of the history of mathematics is to provide insight into the foundations of a mathematical theory by identifying the characteristics of historically earlier formulations of the theory. The conceptual relativism of scientific theories over history is one of the major findings of the history of science since Thomas Kuhn. In this respect, history of mathematics possesses a special interest lacking in the history of other branches of science, because earlier mathematical theories are enduring objects of technical interest and even of further development. Finally, even after the consolidation of Cauchy's arithmetical foundation, Lagrange's emphasis on the algorithmic, operational character of the calculus continued to inform writers of textbooks as well as non-mathematicians such as engineers and physicists who used calculus in their research and teaching.}
