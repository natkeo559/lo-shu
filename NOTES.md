# Magic Squares Relating to Group Theory:

In group theoretic terms, a magic square with all rows, columns, and diagonals adding up to 15 can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group on 9 elements, denoted Sym(9). Formally, let S = {1, 2, ..., 9} and let G be the set of all permutations of S that satisfy the magic square condition, i.e., the sum of every row, column, and diagonal of the corresponding 3x3 square is 15. Then, G is a subgroup of Sym(9), and the operation in G is composition of permutations. The order of G is |G| = 9!, since every permutation of the numbers 1 through 9 satisfies the magic square condition. Therefore, G is a subgroup of Sym(9) of order 9!. One can also study the properties of G using group theoretic techniques. For example, we can compute the stabilizer subgroup of a specific entry in the magic square. This stabilizer subgroup is the set of permutations in G that fix that entry. By studying the structure of this stabilizer subgroup, we can gain insight into the symmetries of the magic square. In summary, a magic square with all rows, columns, and diagonals adding up to 15 can be represented as a subgroup of Sym(9) of order 9!. This group representation allows us to use group theoretic techniques to study the properties of the magic square and its symmetries.
